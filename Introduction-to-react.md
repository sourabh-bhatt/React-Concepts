# Introduction To React

⚠️Gentle Reminder :)

```JSX
<> React is a javascript library !! </>
```

React is a popular library for building dynamic web pages.

- React is declarative a library, which means that you describe what you want the UI to look like, and React takes care of how to render it. This makes React very efficient and easy to use.

- React is component-based, and learn-once-write-anywhere. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
