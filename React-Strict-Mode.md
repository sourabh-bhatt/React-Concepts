# What is <React.StrictMode>

React.StrictMode is used in the development of any react app or certain component. In production strictmode is not used. The need of strictmode is to find different bugs and different errors that may occur in our codebase.

- StrictMode checks eerything twice to make sure the code written in the app is pure. It do so because react dont want any unintended side effects.

- Strict mode prevents errors to be converted into bugs by rechecking and re rendering the codes.
